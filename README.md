# Build a blockchain in JavaScript
Create a simple JavaScript blockchain.

## Blockchain setup
To run app, clone the repository in your terminal with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/eliaahadi/buildBlockchain.git
```
Link packages first by typing this command in terminal:
```
cd buildBlockchain
yarn install
```
To run app, in terminal type:
```
yarn start
```
To run tests, in terminal type:
```
yarn test
```
To view endpoint responses, open up a tool like Postman and type in terminal:
```

```

Then in Postman,
Enter localhost:4001 for URL, and notice the response.
If all goes well, you'll be able to interact with the UI.
