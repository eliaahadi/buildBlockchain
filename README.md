# Build a blockchain in JavaScript
Create a simple JavaScript blockchain.

## Blockchain setup
Link packages first by typing this command in terminal:
```
yarn install
```
To run tests, in terminal type:
```
yarn test
```
To view endpoint responses, open up a tool like Postman and type in terminal:
```
yarn dev
```

Then in Postman,
Enter localhost:3001 for URL, and notice the response.
If all goes well, youâ€™ll find the array of blocks of the blockchain.

## Steps to create one
 1. Blocks
 2. Blockchain
 3. API
 4. Peer Server
 5. Proof of Work
 6. Wallet
 7. Transaction Pool
 8. Miner
